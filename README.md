#DESCRIPTION 

A "joins practice task" typically refers to exercises designed to help individuals practice and understand SQL joins. These tasks generally involve combining data from two or more tables based on specific relationships (using keys like primary or foreign keys).
Hereâ€™s a general description of what a joins practice task might entail:
INNER JOIN (returns rows with matching values in both tables)
LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table)
RIGHT JOIN (returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table)
FULL OUTER JOIN (returns rows when there is a match in either table)
CROSS JOIN (returns the Cartesian product of the two tables)
SELF JOIN (joining a table with itself)
Database Setup:
Use a relational database with multiple tables that are related. Common examples include:
Customers and Orders (where each order is linked to a customer)
Students and Courses (with enrollment information linking students to courses)
Employees and Departments (employees belong to departments)
